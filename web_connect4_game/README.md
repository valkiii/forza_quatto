## 🧠 AI Architecture

### 🔗 Ensemble Composition
Our AI combines **5 trained CNN models** with different experience levels:

| Model | Training Episodes | Weight | Contribution |
|-------|------------------|--------|--------------|
| M1-CNN-750k | 750,000 | 30% | 🎯 **Strategic Leader** |
| M1-CNN-700k | 700,000 | 20% | 🛡️ **Defensive Expert** |
| M1-CNN-650k | 650,000 | 20% | ⚖️ **Balanced Player** |
| M1-CNN-600k | 600,000 | 15% | 🔄 **Pattern Matcher** |
| M1-CNN-550k | 550,000 | 15% | 🎲 **Creative Wildcard** |

### ⚙️ Q-Value Averaging Method

The AI doesn't just pick one model's opinion. Instead:

1. **Each model evaluates** all possible moves
2. **Assigns Q-values** representing move quality (0.0 = terrible, 1.0 = excellent)
3. **Weighted average** combines all opinions using the percentages above
4. **Final decision** balances consensus with strategic diversity

```
Final Q-Value = (0.3 × Model750k) + (0.2 × Model700k) + 
                (0.2 × Model650k) + (0.15 × Model600k) + (0.15 × Model550k)
```

### 🎯 Strategic Components

The AI evaluates moves using multiple strategic factors:

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| 🎯 **Winning Move** | 100% | Immediate victory opportunity |
| 🛡️ **Blocking Move** | 80% | Prevent opponent's winning move |
| 🍴 **Fork Creation** | 60% | Setup multiple winning threats |
| ⚡ **Threat Development** | 40% | Build toward future wins |
| 📍 **Center Control** | 10% | Strategic position advantage |
