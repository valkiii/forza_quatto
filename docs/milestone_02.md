# Milestone 2: Enter the Machine - Tabular Q-Learning from Scratch

*Teaching an AI to think strategically through trial and error*

## The Challenge: From Rules to Learning

After building our heuristic agent that dominated random opponents with 99.8% win rate, I faced an exciting question: could a machine learning agent discover similar strategies through pure experience, without being programmed with explicit rules?

This milestone documents my journey implementing tabular Q-learning from scratch—no libraries, just the raw algorithm. The goal was to understand every component: state encoding, exploration vs exploitation, the Q-learning update rule, and reward shaping.

## Design Decisions: The State Space Problem

Connect 4 has approximately 3^42 ≈ 1.5 × 10^20 possible board states—far too many for tabular methods. I needed a smarter state representation.

### State Encoding: The Relative Board Trick

My key insight was using **relative encoding** (`agents/q_learning_agent.py:49-67`):

```python
def encode_state(self, board_state: np.ndarray) -> str:
    """Encode board state from agent's perspective."""
    relative_board = np.zeros_like(board_state)
    
    # Agent's pieces become 1, opponent's become 2
    relative_board[board_state == self.player_id] = 1
    relative_board[board_state == (3 - self.player_id)] = 2
    
    return ''.join(relative_board.flatten().astype(str))
```

**Why this works:**
- Reduces state space by factor of 2 (agent vs opponent perspective)
- Enables transfer learning—strategies learned as Player 1 work as Player 2
- Simple string hashing for Q-table keys

**Alternative approaches I considered:**
- **Feature extraction**: Count pieces, threats, center control (smaller state space)
- **Board symmetry**: Exploit horizontal mirroring (another 2× reduction)
- **Position abstraction**: Group similar positions (requires domain knowledge)

I chose relative encoding as the sweet spot between simplicity and efficiency.

## The Q-Learning Implementation

### Core Algorithm: The Update Rule

The heart of Q-learning is beautifully simple (`agents/q_learning_agent.py:111-131`):

```python
# Q(s,a) += α[r + γ*max_a'(Q(s',a')) - Q(s,a)]
current_q = self.q_table[(state, action)]
target_q = reward + self.discount_factor * max_next_q
self.q_table[(state, action)] += self.learning_rate * (target_q - current_q)
```

**What this means:**
- **Current estimate**: `Q(s,a)` - what we think this action is worth
- **New evidence**: `r + γ*max(Q(s',a'))` - immediate reward + discounted future value
- **Update**: Move our estimate toward the new evidence, controlled by learning rate α

### Exploration vs Exploitation: Epsilon-Greedy

The classic RL dilemma: explore unknown actions or exploit known good ones?

```python
if self.rng.random() < self.epsilon:
    action = self.rng.choice(legal_moves)  # Explore
else:
    action = self._get_best_action(state, legal_moves)  # Exploit
```

I used **decaying epsilon**: start with 100% exploration (ε=1.0), gradually shift to exploitation (ε=0.05). The decay rate of 0.995 per episode provides a smooth transition.

### Reward Engineering: The Art of Motivation

Designing rewards is crucial—the agent only learns what we incentivize:

```python
def calculate_reward(winner, agent_id, game_length):
    if winner == agent_id:
        return 10.0    # Win bonus
    elif winner is not None:
        return -10.0   # Loss penalty  
    else:
        return 1.0     # Draw reward (better than losing)
```

**Design rationale:**
- **Large win/loss signals**: +10/-10 creates strong preference for winning
- **Draw bonus**: Encourages not losing when winning isn't possible
- **No move penalty**: Avoids rushing to quick defeats

## Training Results: Lessons Learned

After 1,000 episodes of training against random opponents:

```
Episode   200 | Win Rate: 51.0% | Epsilon: 0.134 | Q-table: 26,106
Episode   400 | Win Rate: 53.0% | Epsilon: 0.050 | Q-table: 54,036  
Episode   600 | Win Rate: 50.0% | Epsilon: 0.050 | Q-table: 80,701
Episode   800 | Win Rate: 51.0% | Epsilon: 0.050 | Q-table: 107,886
Episode  1000 | Win Rate: 57.0% | Epsilon: 0.050 | Q-table: 134,865
```

### Performance Analysis

**vs Random Opponents**: 55.6% win rate
- ✅ Better than random baseline (50%)
- ✅ Shows learning is happening
- ❌ Modest improvement (only 5.6 percentage points)

**vs Heuristic Agent**: 2.0% win rate  
- ❌ Completely dominated by strategic opponent
- ❌ Reveals limitation of training only vs random play

### What Went Right

1. **Algorithm correctness**: Q-values converged, exploration decayed properly
2. **State encoding**: 187K states explored—manageable Q-table size
3. **Learning curve**: Gradual improvement from 51% to 57% win rate
4. **Implementation robustness**: No crashes, handles edge cases

### What I Learned the Hard Way

1. **Opponent matters hugely**: Training vs random creates a "random-beating specialist," not a strategic player
2. **State space explosion**: Even with relative encoding, Q-table grew to 187K entries in just 1,000 episodes  
3. **Exploration-exploitation trade-off**: Agent needed longer exploration phase
4. **Reward sparsity**: Only getting feedback at game end makes learning slow

## The Heuristic Reality Check

The most humbling result: our carefully trained Q-learning agent loses 98% of games to the heuristic agent! This highlights a fundamental challenge in RL:

**The heuristic agent "knows" Connect 4 strategy from day one**:
- Always blocks opponent wins
- Always takes its own wins  
- Creates threats strategically

**The Q-learning agent must discover these strategies** through thousands of games of trial and error. Training only vs random opponents, it never learned to handle strategic threats.

## Code Architecture Highlights

### Modular Design Benefits

The clean separation between game logic, agents, and training paid off:

```python
# Easy to swap opponents
opponent = HeuristicAgent(player_id=2) if config["opponent_type"] == "heuristic" else RandomAgent(player_id=2)

# Clean training loop
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    q_agent.reset_episode()
    winner, length = play_training_game(q_agent, opponent)
    # ... logging and evaluation ...
```

### Q-Table Implementation

Using `defaultdict(float)` was perfect for sparse Q-tables:
- Automatic initialization to 0 for unseen state-action pairs
- Memory efficient—only stores visited states  
- Thread-safe for parallel evaluation

## Next Steps: Deeper Learning

The Q-learning experiment revealed both the power and limitations of tabular methods:

**Strengths**: Direct policy inspection, guaranteed convergence, interpretable
**Weaknesses**: State explosion, slow learning, poor generalization

**For Milestone 3**, we'll tackle these with Deep Q-Networks (DQN):
- Neural networks to handle large state spaces
- Experience replay for sample efficiency  
- Target networks for stable training
- Training vs stronger opponents from the start

The foundation is solid—now we scale up the learning power!

## Reproducibility

To reproduce these results:

```bash
# Train Q-learning agent  
python train/quick_q_train.py

# Evaluate performance
python test_q_vs_heuristic.py

# View training logs
cat logs/q_learning_log.csv
```

**Key hyperparameters that worked:**
- Learning rate: 0.3 (faster than default 0.1)
- Epsilon decay: 0.99 (rapid transition to exploitation)
- Reward structure: +10/-10/+1 for win/loss/draw

The machine is learning—slowly but surely!
