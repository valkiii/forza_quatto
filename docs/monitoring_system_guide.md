# Double DQN Training Monitoring System

## Overview

The Double DQN training now includes a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system that tracks learning progress, strategic improvement, and model performance in real-time.

## Key Features

### üîç **Real-Time Monitoring**
- **Episode-by-episode tracking** of rewards, win rates, and strategic decisions
- **Live progress reports** every evaluation period (default: 1000 episodes)
- **Training efficiency metrics** (episodes/hour, time elapsed)
- **Buffer and exploration tracking**

### üìä **Strategic Analysis**
- **Winning move accuracy**: Tracks when agent plays vs misses winning moves
- **Blocking accuracy**: Monitors defensive play against opponent threats  
- **Center preference**: Evaluates positional strategy
- **Strategic score**: Combined metric of tactical performance

### üìà **Performance Evaluation**
- **Multi-opponent testing**: Regular evaluation vs Random and Heuristic agents
- **Skill assessment**: Comprehensive performance scoring
- **Win rate trends**: Historical performance tracking
- **Game length analysis**: Efficiency of play

### üíæ **Data Logging**
- **Detailed CSV logs**: `training_detailed.csv`, `strategic_analysis.csv`
- **JSON reports**: Skill evaluations and final results
- **Model checkpoints**: Saved at configurable intervals
- **Visualization plots**: Training progress charts (when matplotlib available)

## Files Generated

### **Log Files** (saved to `logs/`)
- `training_detailed.csv` - Episode-by-episode training metrics
- `strategic_analysis.csv` - Strategic move analysis
- `final_training_results.json` - Complete final evaluation
- `skill_eval_ep_X.json` - Checkpoint skill assessments
- `training_progress_ep_X.png` - Visualization plots (optional)

### **Model Files** (saved to `models/`)
- `double_dqn_ep_X.pt` - Checkpoint models
- `double_dqn_final.pt` - Final trained model

## Training Progress Reports

### **Episode Reports** (every eval_frequency episodes)
```
üìà TRAINING REPORT - Episode 1000
==================================================
Recent Performance (1000 episodes):
  Win Rate: 75.2%
  Avg Reward: 5.04
  Reward Std: 8.95

```

## Enhanced Reward System

The monitoring system works with the enhanced reward structure:

### **Base Rewards**
- Win: +10.0, Loss: -10.0, Draw: +1.0

### **Strategic Rewards** (immediate feedback)
- Playing winning move: +0.2
- Blocking opponent win: +0.1
- Missing opponent block: -0.1
- Missing own winning move: -0.5
- Center column preference: +0.02

## Usage

### **Basic Training with Monitoring**
```bash
python train/double_dqn_train.py
```

### **Quick Test Training**
```bash
python train/test_monitored_training.py
```

## Configuration

Key monitoring parameters in `create_double_dqn_config()`:
- `eval_frequency`: How often to evaluate and report (default: 1000)
- `save_frequency`: How often to save checkpoints (default: 2000)
- `num_episodes`: Total training episodes (default: 10000)

## Interpreting Results

### **Strategic Score Interpretation**
- **0.0-0.3**: Poor strategic awareness
- **0.3-0.5**: Basic strategic understanding  
- **0.5-0.7**: Good strategic play
- **0.7-1.0**: Excellent strategic mastery

### **Overall Skill Score**
- Weighted combination: 30% vs Random + 70% vs Heuristic
- **0-25%**: Beginner level
- **25-50%**: Intermediate level
- **50-75%**: Advanced level  
- **75-100%**: Expert level

### **Training Progress Indicators**

**Good Learning Signs:**
- ‚úÖ Increasing win rate over time
- ‚úÖ Rising strategic score 
- ‚úÖ Improving winning move accuracy
- ‚úÖ Decreasing exploration rate (epsilon)
- ‚úÖ Growing training steps

**Potential Issues:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Stagnant win rate after many episodes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Very low strategic score (<0.2)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è High missing win move rate
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No improvement vs heuristic opponent

## Advanced Features

### **Convergence Detection**
The system tracks training stability and can identify when learning plateaus.

### **Opponent Adaptation**
Configure different opponent types:
- `"opponent_type": "random"` - Basic random play
- `"opponent_type": "heuristic"` - Strategic rule-based play

### **Custom Evaluation**
The monitoring system can evaluate against custom opponents by modifying the `evaluate_agent_skills()` method.
